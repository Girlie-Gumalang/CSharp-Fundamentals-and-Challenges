# CSharp Fundamentals and Challenges

This is my personal project where I'm enhancing my C# programming skills by tackling different coding problems and challenges. I aim to improve my problem-solving skills through consistent practice. 

> ⚠️ **Note:** This repository is a living project. Some sections remain incomplete for now, but I aim to expand it continuously over time.

## Folders
The repository contains organized topic-folders that each contain a few related problems.

- **Basic Exercises** — Various mixed problems in different areas
- **Data Types** — Focusing in primitive data types 
- **Exception Handling** — Try-catch examples to handle errors
- **For Loops** — Problems focused on the for loop
> As I keep learning and improving, the folders will likely evolve along the way.
